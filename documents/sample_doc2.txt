Python Programming Guide

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

Key Features of Python:
- Easy to learn and use
- Interpreted language (no compilation needed)
- Object-oriented programming support
- Extensive standard library
- Large community and ecosystem
- Cross-platform compatibility

Python Data Types:
1. Numbers: int, float, complex
2. Strings: Sequences of characters
3. Lists: Ordered, mutable collections
4. Tuples: Ordered, immutable collections
5. Dictionaries: Key-value pairs
6. Sets: Unordered collections of unique elements

Control Structures:
- if/elif/else statements for conditional execution
- for loops for iteration over sequences
- while loops for repeated execution based on conditions
- try/except blocks for error handling

Functions in Python:
Functions are defined using the 'def' keyword and can accept parameters and return values. Python supports first-class functions, meaning functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

Popular Python libraries:
- NumPy: Numerical computing
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib: Data visualization
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning
- Django/Flask: Web development
- Requests: HTTP library
