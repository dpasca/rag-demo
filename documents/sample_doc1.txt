Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience, without being explicitly programmed.

There are three main types of machine learning:

1. Supervised Learning: This involves training a model on labeled data, where both input and correct output are provided. Examples include classification (predicting categories) and regression (predicting continuous values).

2. Unsupervised Learning: This involves finding hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. Common techniques include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule learning.

3. Reinforcement Learning: This involves an agent learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.

Key concepts in machine learning include:
- Training data: The dataset used to teach the model
- Features: Individual measurable properties of observed phenomena
- Model: The mathematical representation of a real-world process
- Overfitting: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- Cross-validation: A technique to assess model performance on unseen data

Popular machine learning algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks.
